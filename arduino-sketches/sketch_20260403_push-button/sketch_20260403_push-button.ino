  DigitalReadSerial

  Reads a digital input on pin 2, prints the result to the Serial Monitor

// digital pin 2 has a pushbutton attached to it. Give it a name:
int pushButton = 2;

int state = LOW;      // the current state of the output pin
int reading;           // the current reading from the input pin
int previous = LOW;    // the previous reading from the input pin

// the follow variables are long's because the time, measured in miliseconds,
// will quickly become a bigger number than can be stored in an int.
unsigned long time = 0;           // the last time the output pin was toggled
unsigned long debounce = 200UL;   // the debounce time, increase if the output flickers


// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // make the pushbutton's pin an input:
  pinMode(pushButton, INPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  
  // read the input pin:
  reading = digitalRead(pushButton);

  // if the input just went from LOW and HIGH and we've waited long enough
  // to ignore any noise on the circuit, toggle the output pin and remember
  // the time
  if (reading == HIGH && previous == LOW && millis() - time > debounce)
  {
    if (state == HIGH)
      state = LOW;
    else
      state = HIGH;

    time = millis();
  }

  // print out the state of the button:
  Serial.println(state);

  previous = reading;
  delay(100);  // delay in between reads for stability
}
